# Domain Objects
The domain (business logic) objects for this example have all been implemented for you. The goal of this certification exercise is to learn how to build solutions using Akka components and so your goal is to write components that rely on the business logic contained in these objects.

* `Timeslot` - The internal state of the `BookingSlotEntity`
* `BookingEvent` - The list of possible events emitted by the booking slot entity
* `Participant` - A standard wrapper for a participant's ID and type

For more details on how the domain objects operate, consult the code comments in each file.
