# Flight Endpoint
The flight endpoint is the API through which all clients must go. The mandatory routes have been defined on this component for you, and you'll need to supply the implementation for each of those. 

The flight endpoint will either make use of an entity client or a view client, depending on which route was used. For details on the specification for the API, check the project's root [README.md](../../../../../../README.md).
